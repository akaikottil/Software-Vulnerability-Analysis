Effects on SMARTLEAK
Address Space Layout Randomization (ASLR) : The env variable address will change and be harder to guess
Non executable data sections in memory: No effect.
Stack Guard Protection: No effect.
Glibc format string security checks: Compilation failed.
-Werror=format-string checks if the printf’s first argument is a string literal or not.
Fortify source protections: No effect.

Effects on TWEEZERS
Address Space Layout Randomization (ASLR) : The shellcode address will change and be harder to guess
Non-executable data sections in memory: the shellcode we provide will not execute and we will not get the shell
Stack Guard Protection: No effect
Glibc format string security checks: Compilation error.
Werror=format-string checks if the printf’s first argument is a string literal or not.
Fortify source protections: our attack fails as %n in format strings of printf is allowed only if it is stored in read-only memory.
