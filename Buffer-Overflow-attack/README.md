# Buffer-Overflow-Attack
The task was to reverse engineer a given binary and exploit the buffer overflow vulnerability present in it. We were using Ghidra to analyze the binary. We initially, idebtified the vulnerable function in the binary. We then utilized Eclipse to debug and carry out the stack smashing attack. Lastly, we have attached key screenshots to our task.
